        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a wonderful bread from Slovenia with a sweet, nutty filling. 
            Due to the spelling and pronunciation (paw-tee'-tzah) it's very hard 
            to find the recipe.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1½ teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ cup milk, lukewarm</li>
            <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>6 egg yolks</li>
            <li>1⅓ cups milk</li>
            <li>5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 cup honey</li>
            <li>1½ cups raisins</li>
            <li>1½ cups chopped walnuts</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a small mixing bowl, dissolve yeast, 1 teaspoon sugar, and 3 
                tablespoons of the flour in warm milk. Mix well, and let stand 
                until creamy, about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large mixing bowl cream the butter with the remaining sugar. 
                Add the egg yolks one at a time, beating well after each addition. 
                Add the yeast mixture, remaining milk, 4 cups of flour and the salt; 
                mix well. Add the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring 
                well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn 
                it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and 
                elastic, about 8 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the 
                dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp 
                cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 
                1 hour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lightly grease one or two cookie sheets. Deflate the dough and 
                turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into 
                two equal pieces and roll Out to 1/4 to 1/2 inch thickness. Spread 
                each piece with melted butter, honey, raisins, walnuts and cinnamon. 
                Roll each piece up like a jelly roll and pinch the ends. Place 
                seam side down onto the prepared baking sheets. Let rise until 
                double in volume. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 60 minutes or 
                until the top is golden brown.
            </li>
        </ol>
