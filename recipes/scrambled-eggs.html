        <h2 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon mayonnaise or salad dressing</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon water (Optional)</li>

                In a cup or small bowl, whisk together the eggs, mayonnaise and 
                water using a fork. Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat. 
                Pour in the eggs, and stir constantly as they cook. Remove the 
                eggs to a plate when they are set, but still moist. Do not over 
                cook. Never add salt or pepper until eggs are on plate, but these 
                are also good without.
